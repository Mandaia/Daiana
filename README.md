The code and SS for the mobile app are in a word document because I recently changed my laptop and somehow lost the application on the old one that doesn't work anymore.
I found this word for the app in an e-mail to a prof.

The website is a little project from the first semester. (not much but honest work)

The hangman game is a simple game in python.

And there is also the form in C# with the database - an organization with adding and deleting teams, adding members and asigning roles to them.
